This was a project for the ETHGlobal hackathon. It is a decentralized social media
app built with Scaffold-ETH and ReactJS, and deployed on the matic testnet. A presentation
and demo of the app can be found here:

The basic concept of the app is that governance protocols allow groups to moderate feeds,
which then work roughly the same as twitter feeds. I implemented a feed, a voting mechanism,
and a message system, all in a smart contract.
